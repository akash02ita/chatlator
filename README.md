# Multi-Language-Chat-App

Chatlator is a multi-language chat web application that allows individuals to communicate in their respective native languages. With Chatlator, users can type in their native language and have their messages translated for the recipient in real time. This eliminates language barriers and enables individuals who speak different languages to understand each other easily. Additionally, Chatlator can be used as a language learning tool, as it allows users to view the original text alongside the translated version. This allows for convenient practice and improvement of language skills.

In the sign up page, the new user enters their details, first entering their first and last names, followed by the email address and password.

After that, the user can select their first language by clicking on “Please select first language”. 
This will present the user with several language options to choose from. The user can select one of the options by just clicking.

In our case, the user chose “English” and the sign up page should look like this.
Then clicking on “Sign up” redirects to the user-specific “Chatting” page.

Chat page for John Doe. It is empty, as no chats/users have been added. The user can add by clicking on the plus sign and getting a pop-up that is shown in the following screenshot

<img width="443" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-30 at 10 44 38 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64262868/210037050-95570769-a632-46b6-b99f-0066f56f984f.png">

In our example, the user selected Spanish.
Clicking the “Search for random people” will take the user to a waiting page

<img width="441" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-30 at 10 45 06 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64262868/210037072-19b39619-552f-48d8-8353-fc2eda9f5360.png">

The waiting page consists of other users whose first language is the language you want to learn and the language they want to learn is your first language, our app matches users like this. In the given example, we can see Carlos’s name pop up as his first language is Spanish(the language John wants to learn) and Carlos wants to learn English which is John’s first language

<img width="430" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-30 at 10 45 40 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64262868/210037106-b2d8250c-b283-4388-98f3-ab6a5be91c8a.png">

If Carlos sends the request first, this is how it will appear on John’s screen. John can choose “Accept” to go back to the chat page with Carlos added as one of the contacts

A user can add multiple friends/contacts speaking different languages. For example, the user wants to add a random person who speaks German
